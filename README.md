## Python for Everybody (PY4E)
https://www.py4e.com



Hello and welcome to my site where you learn Python even if you have no programming background.


1: Installing Python

The first task is to work through the installation steps including installing Python and text editor.

2: Why Program?

We learn why one might want to learn to program, and look at the basic issues with learning to program.

3: Variables, expressions and statements

We learn how to make variables and store data in those variables.

4: Conditional Execution

We look at how Python executes some statements and skips others.

5: Functions

Take a brief look at how Python implements the 'store and use later' programming pattern.

6: Loops and Iterations

We look at how Python repeats statements using looping structures.

7: Strings

We look at how Python stores and manipulates textual data using string variables and functions.

8: Files

We learn how to open data files on your computer and read through the files using Python.


9: Lists

We look at Python's simplest data structure - the list. Lists can store more than one item in a variable.

10: Dictionaries

The dictionary data structures allows us to store multiple values in an object and look up the values by their key.


11: Tuples

The tuple is a Python data structure that is like a simple and efficient list.


12: Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions allow us to search for patterns in strings and extract data from strings using the regular expression programming language.

13: Network Programming

We take a quick look at how data moves across the network using the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) and how we write programs to read data across the network.

14: Using Web Services

Web services allow a program to access data available in a different server.


15: Object-Oriented Programming

We do a quick look at how Python supports the Object-Oriented programming pattern.

16: Databases

Databases give us very fast random access to large amounts of data. There is a lot of material in this chapter as we learn the Structured Query Language (SQL).

17: Data Visualization

In this section, we learn to scrape data from the network, store the data in a
